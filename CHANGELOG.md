== 1.3.2 ==
Enhancements:

Enhancements:
* Added tracking of Coffer Key Shards owned.
* Added better waypoint setting for Delves and Wordsoul Memories (thanks, BelegCufea!)
* Enhanced Vault display, color coded by tier (thanks, BelegCufea!)

Fixes:
* Show the Delve and Worldsoul tooltips _above_ the character tip when LDB display or minimap is set to the bottom of the screen. This should prevent those tips being truncated or off-screen.
* Fixed a bug that caused tooltips to go all wonky if the scale was set to anything other than 100%. Whoops!
* Reworked tooltip show/hide code (yet again), to hopefully make it more reliable and resilient.

Fixes:
* More robust gilded stash count retrieval. You should see much fewer instances where stash count is unknown.
