== DelveBuddy TODO: PTR Edition ==
* If you enter a bountiful delve, and you don't have any coffer keys, show raid warning
* Improve Tooltip UI
* Also show/track Worldsoul memories POIs?
* Reduce how many times collect data called?
* Put API calls in locals for (tiny) perf optimization?

== Stuff that's broken in 11.2 ==
* Keys earned wrong? OR wait, maybe it *does* work??
    * Coffer Key weekly quest IDs different?
* New delve missing
    * Not in delve waypoint list
* Overcharged reporting wrong?
    * Are OC delves still a thing?
* Vault reward iLvls are off

== Stuff that seems to work in 11.2 ==
