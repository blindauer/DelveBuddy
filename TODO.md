= DelveBuddy TODO =

* Improve Tooltip UI

* Improve window UI

* Implement options

* Implement clicking on delves to make waypoint and/or TomTom

* If you enter a delve, and you don't have any coffer keys, show raid warning

* Put API calls in locals for (tiny) perf optimization

* Reduce how many times collect data called?

* Auto-size columns based on content (fix it!)

* Make tooltips stay on screen when hovered over

== Stuff that's broken in 11.2 ==
* Keys earned wrong
    * Coffer Key weekly quest IDs different?
* New delves missing
    * Not in delve waypoint list

== Stuff that seems to work in 11.2 ==
* Keys owned correct (is same item ID?)
