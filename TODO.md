== DelveBuddy TODO ==
* Bug: delver's bounty reminder happens on every inventory update (should just be 1 minute)
    * Would be good to refactor some of that stuff, too.
* Feature: reminder for Shrieking Quartz? (if not looted/have bounty)
* Feature: show changelog on first login after update?

Tweaking:
* Make stuff not break when showing tips in combat
* Hide delve-o-bot when delve in progress?

Testing:
* What if in combat (looks all fucked up)
* What about nemesis item on CD? 
* Test using nemesis item
