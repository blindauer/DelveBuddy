== DelveBuddy TODO ==
* Bug: delver's bounty reminder happens on every inventory update (should just be 1 minute)
    * Would be good to refactor some of that stuff, too.
* Feature: reminder for Shrieking Quartz? (if not looted/have bounty)
* Feature: show changelog on first login after update?
* Nit: Comes up awkwardly when minimap at bottom center of screen (user report)
    * Make option to put it in a real window?
