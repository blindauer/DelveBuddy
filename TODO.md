== DelveBuddy TODO ==
* Comes up awkwardly when minimap at bottom center of screen (user request)
    * Make option to put it in a real window?
* Feature: tooltip on delve which displays the story?
* Bug: tooltip display/hide a bit wonky - sometimes stays up when it shouldn't. Clean that all up.
* Bug: IsDelveComplete sometimes fails
    * E.g.: Excavation Site 9, A Knightly Quest: when at stage 3 (the boss: "0/1 Beste Glatisant defeated", assumes complete)
    * BUT THEN: stage 4 (0/1 Treasure Found) says not complete :(
* Bug: in-Delve detection broken when you warp to Ethereal place (in Mycomancer, for Fungal Folly?)
