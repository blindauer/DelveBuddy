== DelveBuddy TODO ==
* Feature: tooltip on delve which displays the story?
* Bug: IsDelveComplete sometimes fails
    * E.g.: Excavation Site 9, A Knightly Quest: when at stage 3 (the boss: "0/1 Beste Glatisant defeated", assumes complete)
    * BUT THEN: stage 4 (0/1 Treasure Found) says not complete :(
* Add some kinda UI scale to make bigger? - user request
