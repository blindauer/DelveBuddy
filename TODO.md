== DelveBuddy TODO: PTR Edition ==
* Also show/track Worldsoul memories POIs?

== Stuff that's broken in 11.2 ==
* Keys earned wrong? OR wait, maybe it *does* work??
    * Coffer Key weekly quest IDs different?
* Overcharged reporting wrong?
    * Are OC delves still a thing?

== Stuff that seems to work in 11.2 ==
* Keys owned correct (is same item ID)

== Test Cases ==
* Enter bountiful delve with 0 keys: Immediate key warning
* Enter non-bountiful delve with no keys: No key warning
* Use Bounty: stop bounty flashing
